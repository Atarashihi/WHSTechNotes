Long ago in a distant land, I AKU unleashed an unspeakable evil. Until a foolish Samurai worrior stepped forth, to oppose me. (insert clangins sounds) Before the final blow was struck, i opened a portal in time and flung him into the future. Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is AKU.

computer science allows me to use clocks programmed to follow the time and I also use my phone and chromebook daily. Without it I would have no way of telling time or interactiong with the outside world. Also i would be failing math w/o a calculator.

I researched game designer. Game developers create systems for the game as well as having input on the story and IP to make the game fun to play. You would need some basic understanding of game programming and game design, with a sense of creativity. A degree in computer science or similar would be helpful but not neccesary.it speculated the the video game industry will increase by over 78% over the nect few yrs. puting my coding skills to use by creating thingws i love seems like a dream come true.

coding can improve problem solving skills by requiring oneself to fix problems in thier code. coding is required in other fields that use any type of computer technology. (EX: heart monitors in hospitals.) Coding can support creativity by forcing someone to think outside the box to get computers to do things for them. (EX: thermometers for finding tempurature.)
