Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Long ago in a distant land, I AKU unleashed an unspeakable evil. Until a foolish Samurai worrior stepped forth, to oppose me. (insert clangins sounds) Before the final blow was struck, i opened a portal in time and flung him into the future. Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is AKU.

Following instructions is important to coding because rules and directions are what code is as a whole. If you give the wrong instructions when coding, your code wont work. And if you dont follow instructions, you cant give decent instructions to be followed.

computer science allows me to use clocks programmed to follow the time and I also use my phone and chromebook daily. Without it I would have no way of telling time or interactiong with the outside world. Also i would be failing math w/o a calculator.

I researched game designer. Game developers create systems for the game as well as having input on the story and IP to make the game fun to play. You would need some basic understanding of game programming and game design, with a sense of creativity. A degree in computer science or similar would be helpful but not neccesary.it speculated the the video game industry will increase by over 78% over the nect few yrs. puting my coding skills to use by creating thingws i love seems like a dream come true.

coding can improve problem solving skills by requiring oneself to fix problems in thier code. coding is required in other fields that use any type of computer technology. (EX: heart monitors in hospitals.) Coding can support creativity by forcing someone to think outside the box to get computers to do things for them. (EX: thermometers for finding tempurature.)

tehcnology can effect the voting process by making voting more accesible. but, it can also hurt elections when problems in the system change the true number of votes.

It's important protect your info online becuase keeping your info safe can prevent identity theft, fraud, and other things that could lead to reputational or financial harm. To protect your info online you can lock your info behind a password, two factor authentication/ and be more mindful about what you share online. I have not shared anything personal online. You can balance collaboration and safety by being mindful of what you share, using privacy settings, and being aware of potential risks of sharing data.

The Ulkraine - Russian war is a war effort from russia trying to invade Ukraine in an effert to reinstate it into russian territory. This war could include the use off missiles and nuclear warheads aimed and detonated by computer programs. Like the computers used to remotely aim missiles ore the contraption that allows nukes to detonate above the ground.
 Computers can also be used to address large issues like this in the future. Future wars can be brought to light by fast movement of information through the internet. like news stations getting news of trageties during war time like the people hurt by the war.

 Advances in agricultural technologies make4s food ore affordable by reducing labor and making transportation of goods easier, ruducing thier cost completely. For example, something simple like automatic sprinklers, or something complex like a automatic harvester. And a truck to transport crops to places where people can go to buy them. Although, using advances in technologies inappropriately can have serois drawbacks; like usibg this tecvhnology irresponibly can cause harm to the land & crops.

 Im exited about the upcoming rise of enhanced virtual reality because of it's uses in training possibilites. Training that could be used for improved practices and equipment for sport athletes in general. Although, People could begin to rely on virtual realty too much as they may enjoy it more than thier real lives.

 In the first semester of this class i really apprecitated the freesom the students were given. this class made coding feel more like a calming hobby rather than a class.This sem,ester i'd really like to focus on python insteasd of block coding as i found it boring. Im interested in pursuing both python and unity certification. as i would like to go into game development.

 I think government intervention impacts technology companies and their users negetively because the people in the government ignore the serios issues.

  Coding flaws and miscomunication in software can lead to accidents by limiting a pilots control of an aircraft. 
 For example, if a faliure happens in the plane and the pilot cant use the controls to adapt to it, the plane could fall out the sky.
  Computer algorithims prevent collisions by using radar to locate and direct the planes. Failiurs in the radar technology could give innacurate readings 
 which could cause innacurate instructions, that could cause a plane collision.

 Last week, i learned about my phones alarm when the charging port is obstructed. It woke me up in the middle with an an alert about something in my charging port and forced me to stay up for an hour fixing it. Now i know i wont have to guesse.

 Technology can be used to stay up to date on modern language by giving them the ability to search what new slang terms mean. Integrating modern language into learning tools could make complicated termsv eaisier for younger generations to understand. I think slang is left unchanged becuase it allows creativity to shine to make sense of difficult languages. Misunderstandings can impact interactions between people if its used inappropriatly.

 I beleive the cell phone ban was not beneficial for students or teachers. The state of texas doing this withoutb regarding the massive school shooting problem the state was foolish, and the students grades wont improve either. As a student, I find that the only people who ever learn are the people who want to learn. And the students who dont want to learn will either use their phones anyway, or they will find another way to use distract themselves.

# September 22, 2025
 I think working in a virtual store is beneficail because it open up more jobs. You see,  many people have been working completely virtually for years. And virtual stores will just add a more accessible mean for income for many people. For example, a person who cant walkcan wqork at thier computer fromn home. Or, a deaf individual

 SNAP being shut down is a big deal because people from lowbudget neighborhoods or people with low income wont be able to afford food.
The internet could help people find things like food banks or other food drives in thier area. Although, people could have trouble affording the internet or contact with others. I would create a device called the FLDSMDF. And this miracoulous machine would turn water, into food.
